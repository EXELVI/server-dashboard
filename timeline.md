# Steps of the project

1. (untracked) Seeing if project could be done, by configuring a basic web server and configuring the kiosk mode on an external monitor.
2. Creating a basic app with next.js with a basic page and API route to get system information.
3. Improving the app to show more system information and adding styling.
4. Formatting raw CPU data in API route into JSON.
5. Added RAM, Disk and Sesnsor information to the API route.
6. Created section in the page to show system information.
7. Created the Arduino code for the ENV sensors and configured the API route (external backend) for the data.
8. Added ENV sensors to the API route and page.
9. Added a Printing Queue section to the page.
10. Restyled the page with a better layout and colors.
11. Removed priting queue (not working properly) and added a Scan Menu with a websocket.
12. Added Mail sending feature for scanned documents.
13. Restayled some components with shadcn/ui.
14. Added other comands such as data refresh, cache clearing.
15. Added logs viewing.
16. Added process list viewing.
17. Added disk health, mount point information.
18. Created the kiosk README.
19. Created a demo mode to simulate data without requiring real server data or hardware sensors for showcasing.
20. Added websocket to env sensors for quicker updates.
21. Updated README and bug fixes.
